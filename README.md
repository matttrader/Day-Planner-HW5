# homework-5
The goal of the homework five project was to create a calendar app to organize and schedule your work day.  The scheduler app has the work day laid out from 9am to 5pm with plenty of text space in each hour block to record and manage all of your day's tasks.  Ideally, the goal was also to add color funtionality to the calendar time blocks to show the present hour of the day, as well as different color coded shading for the past hours of the day and the upcoming hours of the day (although I'm still working on that piece of the application).   

The purpose of this scheduler application project was to combine and deploy the concepts and skills of html, CSS and JavaScript recently introduced.   

This scheduler application is a combination of an html file with a JavaScript source link and a CSS stylesheet link.

Below is a screenshot of the "Work Day Scheduler" application.
